# Efficient Delivery Vehicle Routing with Custom Hash Table
This project implements an efficient delivery vehicle routing system using a custom-built hash table.
The goal is to optimize delivery paths by quickly mapping delivery points and vehicle availability, 
demonstrating an understanding of data structures and algorithm design in a practical application.
